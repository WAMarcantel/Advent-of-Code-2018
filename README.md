# Advent-of-Code-2018
This repository holds my answers to the Advent of Code 2018 questions.

## Advent of Code
The [Advent of Code][AoC] is an [Advent Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) that is based on programming questions. I like it because it asks questions that are less about optimal solutions to very specific problems, and more about developing overall problem solving skills through programming.

## My Solutions
My solutions are free to use, but I'm sure they are nowhere near optimal or clean. I will make an attempt to clean them over time, so check back in a little while to see some cleaner solutions.
